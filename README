About:

  This is a set of stand-alone bio-relevant flash widgets.
  The set currently contains:

    1. A plasmid visualization widget.
    2. A text-based sequence visualization widget.

  This repository contains only a small piece of code that utilizes the 
  much larger codebases of the DNA Vector Editor and BioFlex projects respectively.
  
    https://code.google.com/p/vectoreditor/
    https://code.google.com/p/bioflex/

  The DNA Vector Editor and BioFlex projects were written by researchers 
  at the Joint BioEnergy institute:

    http://jbei.org/

  For copyright and licensing information, please refer to the respective information
  contained in the respective code-bases.

  We are hoping to port these Flex widgets to HTML5 + JavaScript at some point.

Requirements:

  Java SDK and JRE.
  Ant build tool.
  Flex 3 SDK and visualization SDK (but the Makefile can install this for you).
  The wget utility (only required for installing Flex and viz SDK).
  Git.

  On debian / ubuntu you can install java, ant, wget and git like so:

    sudo aptitude install openjdk-6-jdk openjdk-6-jre ant wget git-core

  If you already have Flex 3 SDK, edit the first line of the Makefile to point to
  your Flex 3 SDK dir. 

  If you do not have the Flex 3 SDK installed, install it with:

    sudo make flex-3-install

  If you do not have the Flex 3 visualization SDK installed, install it with:

    sudo make flex-dataviz-install

Compiling:

  Simply use the command:

    make

  The swf files will be saved to the swf directory.

Examples:

  There are HTML/JavaScript examples using the widgets in the examples directory.
  Some of the functionality will not work if you open these html files directly from your filesystem.
  To work around this, you can create a symlink to your local web-server's document root, e.g:

    sudo ln -s flash-bio-widgets /var/www/flash-bio-widgets

  And open the examples via your local web server:

    firefox http://localhost/flash-bio-widgets/examples/
